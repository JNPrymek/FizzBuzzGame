# FizzBuzzGame
A Fizz Buzz game created for the LSUS Computer Science Club.

This project started out as a simple example of different ways to code a FizzBuzz method.
If the given number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz".  If it's a multiple of 5, print "Buzz".  If it's a multiple of 3 & 5, print "FizzBuzz".  Otherwise, print the number.
The challenge begins when variations are added.  Maybe the factors should be 4 and 7 instead of 3 and 5.  Maybe the words should be Bizz and Flub.  

I didn't stop with a method to print the answers.  I made a command line java game out of it.  Feel free to download it and have a try.
Executables can be found in the builds/ directory.
